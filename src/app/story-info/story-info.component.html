        Kevin and Emily's story begins in high school.  They were juniors at Rolling Meadows High School and it was almost 
        prom season.  Kevin had been nervous to talk to Emily so he figured "Hey, I'll do the unheard of...ask a girl to 
        prom who I had never talked to before!" And so Kevin asked Emily to prom and she said yes! 
        Although they started out the day as friends, Emily and Kevin quickly started falling for eachother.  They had
        a great time taking pictures together and dancing together.

        12 DMB concerts that they have gone to together to this day.

        Their Senior year of high school finished up and they attended their second round of prom together.  This time,
        Emily and Kevin had been dating so there wasn't any awkward asking to prom this time...

        It was then time for high school graduation (wearing purple and gold together...FORESHADOW) where 
        Emily and Kevin were going to go off to different universities.  Kevin attended the University of Illinois at 
        Urbana-Champaign and Emily went to Columbia, Missouri to attend Mizzou.  They were able to visit each other 
        once every month or so

    The Proposal

        We flew home to Chicago for Christmas like we always do except this time was different.  Emily had a day planned in the 
        city with her brothers on December 22nd, 2016.  She went to the Art Museum and grabbed lunch downtown near Millenium Park.  
        With the help of Emily's brother Mac, Kevin was able to plan a surprise proposal.  At the same location as their 
        first city date, Kevin would be standing at the top of the stairs which overlooked downtown Chicago.  Kevin called her 
        name after she reached the top of the stairs and she instantly knew what was happening.  Kevin got down on one knee 
        and proposed to the girl of his dreams followed by a quick YES!  
        Emily heard cheering from afar, the second surprise, which was their families 
        witnessing the proposal from Cindy's Rooftop Bar.
